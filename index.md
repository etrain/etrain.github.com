I am a Vice President in AI and High Performance Computing at [Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)](https://www.hpe.com/), where I lead the Determined AI team. Previously, I was CEO and co-founder of [Determined AI](https://determined.ai), a startup operating in the large scale AI/machine learning space that was acquired by HPE in June 2021. Before that, I was an Entrepreneur in Residence with [Amplify Partners](https://amplifypartners.com/).

I received my Ph.D in [Computer Science at UC Berkeley](http://cs.berkeley.edu/) working in the [AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu). I was also affiliated with the [BAIR Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). I was advised by [Mike Franklin](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~franklin/), but I also did a lot of work with [Ben Recht](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/), [Mike Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/), [Ameet Talwalkar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/), and others. My research focused on the intersection of distributed systems and machine learning. I like building systems that solve problems faster and better than anyone thought possible. During my time at Berkeley, I was involved in projects including [MLlib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/), [MLbase](http://www.mlbase.org/), and [KeystoneML](https://keystone-ml.org/).

Prior to Berkeley, I spent a few years in industry. From 2007 to 2010 I was a quant analyst and then senior analyst at [MDT Advisers](https://www.mdtadvisers.com), an asset management firm. After MDT I spent a couple of years doing data science and engineering work at [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com). I also spent a summer working for [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/). I am a graduate of [Dartmouth College](https://www.dartmouth.edu/), where my undergraduate thesis research focused on the security of Trusted Platform Modules, working with [Sean W. Smith](https://cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/). I also hold an M.S. in Computer Science from Berkeley.

In my spare time, I like golf, cooking, and [jumping off of high things](https://www.dartmouthsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=11600&ATCLID=683330).
