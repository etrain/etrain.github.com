I am a third year Ph.D student studying [Computer Science at UC Berkeley](http://cs.berkeley.edu/) working in the [AMPLab](http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu). I'm advised by [Mike Franklin](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~franklin/). My research interests lie at the intersection of distributed systems and analytics. I like building systems that solve problems faster and better than anyone thought possible.

Prior to Berkeley, I spent a few years in industry. From 2007 to 2010 I was a quant analyst and then senior analyst at [MDT Advisers](http://www.mdtadvisers.com), an asset management firm. More recently I spent a couple of years doing data science and engineering work at [Recorded Future](http://www.recordedfuture.com). I also spent a summer working for [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/). I am a graduate of [Dartmouth College](http://www.dartmouth.edu/), where my undergraduate thesis research focused on the security of Trusted Platform Modules, working with [Sean W. Smith](http://cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/)

In my spare time, I like golf, cooking, and [jumping off of high things](http://www.dartmouthsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=11600&ATCLID=683330).

You can find me on [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ersparks/), [google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hs3AnAkAAAAJ), [twitter](https://twitter.com/evanrsparks), [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=etrain), or [github](http://github.com/etrain/).

My e-mail address is lastname at cs dot berkeley dot edu.
