My research interests focus on distributed analytics of large scale datasets. I was heavily involved in the initial design and implementation of [MLlib](http://) and currently spend most of my time on [KeystoneML](http://keystone-ml.org/) - each of which sprung out of the [MLbase](http://mlbase.org) project.
